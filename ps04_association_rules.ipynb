Hence, the app could display the Vegan Smooth Chocolate Nutritional Shake to customers who have added the Sweet Vanilla Bean flavor to their cart. The value of 80.00 for the lift shows that there is a very high likelihood that the two shakes are bought together. <p> Similarly, rules regarding itemset [7976, 16019] show that if customers buy One Plant-Based Chocolate Flavor Nutritional Shake Drink Mix they are likely to buy All-In-One French Vanilla Nutritional Shake Sachet and viceversa. Although the support and confidence do not significantly differ from the previous example, the high lift of the rule (97.66) suggests that implementing an offer discount for purchasing both items together could be an effective strategy. <p> Finally, rules involving hand soaps (itemset [27544, 39162]) indicate that 12% of customers who buy Lemon Verbena Hand Soap also buy Clean Day Basil Hand Soap. However, the lift of the rule suggests there is a moderate relationship between the hand soaps.

    "The extracted association rules on `DEPT_FOOD` and `DEPT_VEGGIES` suggest strong relationships between several items. <p> Firstly, customers who purchase raspberries are likely to purchase strawberries. Indeed, the moderately high value of the lift (4.24) indicates that the two products are strongly correlated. Hence, it would be advisable to suggest strawberries when a client adds raspberries to their cart. <p> Secondly, we can observe a moderate association between organic yellow onions and organic garlics. This can be explained because onions and garlic appear together in many recipes. What is more, customers purchasing some organic product usually show preference for buying multiple organic items, rather than just a single product. This is the case of the last association rule, which shows that clients purchasing organic bananas and organic hass avocado are likely to also purchase organic raspberries. <p> The associaton between limes and organic cilantro suggests that customers generally buy them together as they are key ingredients in Mexican cuisine. Therefore, it would be a good idea to display limes in the shopping app right after customers have searched organic cilantro. <p> It should be noted that there is a lack of strong associations for bakery products compared to vegetables. This suggests that bakery items are bought more independently or not as frequently in combination with other bakery or vegetable items. Hence, the shopping app should focus more on personalized vegetable suggestions. It is also worth highlighting that, despite having the same number of transactions (5000) for both pharmacy and veggies-bakery departments, we were able to increase the minimum support threshold from 0.001 to 0.005 for veggies-bakery while still obtaining a similar number of association rules. This indicates that items from the veggie-bakery department (particularly from the veggie department) have more frequent item combinations than pharmacy items. However, the decrease in the lift value for veggies-bakery rules compared to pharmacy items indicates that pharmacy products are more likely to be co-purchased."
