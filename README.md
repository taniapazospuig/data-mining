## Data Mining Practicum - Universitat Pompeu Fabra

This repository contains my deliverables for the **Data Mining** course, a third-year subject in the Bachelor's degree on *Mathematical Engineering on Data Science* at Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona.

### About the Course

- **Instructor**: Carlos Castillo  
- **Institution**: Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona  
- **Link to Course Materials**: [Data Mining Course by Carlos Castillo](https://github.com/chatox/data-mining-course)

The course instructors provided the coding structure and commentary templates in each practical session to guide the exercises, and I have written my solutions based on this framework. Full course materials, including the original practicum structure, can be found in the official repository.
