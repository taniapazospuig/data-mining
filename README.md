## Data Mining Practicum - Universitat Pompeu Fabra

This repository contains my deliverables for the **Data Mining** course, part of the Bachelorâ€™s Degree in Mathematical Engineering in Data Science at Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona.

### About the Course

- **Instructor**: Carlos Castillo  
- **Institution**: Universitat Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona

The coding structure and commentary templates in each practical session were provided by the course instructors to guide the exercises, and I have written my solutions based on this framework. Full course materials, including the original practicum structure, can be found in the official repository linked above.
